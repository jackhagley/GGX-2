# GGX

## GGX is a piece of software for outputting pdf data visualisations.
It is designed to be a building block between data and native PDF. 
GGX is written in Processing. GGX is not currently in active development.

## Origin
The idea behind this project came about when I had to make hundreds of pages of graphs. The layout for each of the pages was the same, and I did not want to do it all by hand.

## Concept
The idea behind this project was that data visualisation could be approached in a node-based environment. Tables could be processed and connected to visualisations by cables. The environment is influenced by music software such as Reason and Pure Data.

## Modes
DATA MODE / VISUALS MODE
Switch between Data Mode and Visuals Mode using TAB.

### Data Mode
Join up the data with the visuals using Cables. You can connect numerical data to different graphs number inputs to visualise the data, or connect string data to the labels to label the graphs.

### Visuals Mode
Visuals mode is a cell-based layout that allows the arrangement of graphs and graphics.

## Usage
The best use of GGX is to output many pages of reports where the basic structure is the same, but doing the work by hand would extremely time consuming. It is designed to be used in concert with Illustrator.
