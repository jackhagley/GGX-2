# GGX

## GGX is a piece of software for outputting pdf data visualisations.
It is designed to be a building block between data and native PDF. 
GGX is written in Processing. GGX is not currently in active development.

## Origin
The idea behind this project came about when I had to make hundreds of pages of graphs. The layout for each of the pages was the same, and I did not want to do it all by hand.

## Concept
I wanted to have a code based approach to data visualisation that would output good quality PDFs to my exact specifications. As there was nothing out there that did this, I made it myself.

## Usage
- output many pages of reports where the basic structure is the same, but doing the work by hand would extremely time consuming. It is designed to be used in concert with Illustrator.
- generate data-driven visualisations that can be updated live
- generate data-driven visualisations that would be time-consuming and error prone to update manually
